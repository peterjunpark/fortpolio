## Experience

### Completed Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp

 **University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies**, 2023

I excelled in completing a coding bootcamp program offered by the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies.
Through this intensive proram, I gained a solid understand of web dev fundamentals, encompassing foundational web technologies,
front-end and back-end libraries, testing, and computer science principles.

Through multiple group projects, I collaborated with team members, gaining practical experience in working with other developers.

### Technical Writer, CX

**Trapeze Group**, 2022 - 2023; **Toogood Financial Systems**, 2021-2022

As a technical writer, I played a vital role in bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and end-users.
From API documentation to user guides, I made technical information approachable, contributing to a seamless and satisfying user journey.

I adopted the [docs-as-code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code) methodology, valuing version-controlled and topic-oriented,
modular content with the [DITA XML](https://www.oxygenxml.com/dita/1.3/specs/archSpec/base/introduction-to-dita.html) specification as my medium.
Documentation was a fundamental part of the software development process. I collaborated closely with design and development teams to ensure that
documentation evolved in tandem with the product, providing users with up-to-date and accessible resources. 

### Copywriter, SEO

**Sukoshi Mart**, 2020-2021

At this start-up ecommerce brand, I had the opportunity to wear many hats, but concentrated most of my bandwidth on copywriting, search engine marketing, and 
on-page and technical SEO. Through SEO, I was exposed to and started to excited about web technologies.

### Received B.A. in English

**York University**, 2018

I graduated from York University with a B.A. in English Studies with French Bilingual Distinction. My chief interests in this program were
theoretical linguistics, Romantic literature, and poetry.
