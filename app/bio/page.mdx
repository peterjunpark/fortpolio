# About

Peter is a full stack developer and technical writer based in Toronto, Canada.

Continual learning is integral to my approach, whether it involves creating engaging front-end interfaces or designing server-side solutions.
My goal is to deliver code that aligns with both user expectations and business objectives.
And my commitment to detail and adherence to best practices help ensure the dependability of my work.

As a technical writer, I play a vital role in bridging the gap between complex technical concepts and end-users.
My dedication to the docs-as-code methodology, including modularity and version control, means that I treat documentation as a fundamental part of the development process.
I collaborate closely with development teams to ensure that documentation evolves in tandem with the product, providing users with up-to-date and accessible resources.
From API documentation to user guides, I strive to make technical information approachable, contributing to a seamless and satisfying user journey.
