# Projects

Some projects I've been working on recently â€” to improve my skills, experiment with unfamiliar technologies, or just for fun.

## [Crosswordfish](https://crosswordfish.vercel.app)

As a crossword enjoyer, I'm peeved by the fact that there are no good websites to play crossword puzzles.
The ones out there today are either infested with ads, cost a subscription fee, or have less-than-stellar UX.

Enter Crosswordfish: a crossword puzzle generator powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5.
The crossword grid and clues fill the screen, the grid is keyboard navigable, and I think it pretty easy on the eyes (thanks [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)).

In working on this project, I learned a lot about the intricacies of top-down state management through [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

## [Y (Twytter)](https://twytter-1.vercel.app)

A Twitter clone. Not the most original project. I built Y in an effort to get comfortable with Next.js as a _full stack_ framework
using its controversial new features at the time: the App Router and its ~~experimental~~ Server Actions.

My main learning outcomes in building this were Prisma ORM, handling database migrations via Prisma, basic PostgresQL, and Auth.js for authentication.

## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A sorting algorithm visualizer to demonstrate common sorting algorithms.

## ShelterSeek

My team and I built this as our capstone project at our coding bootcamp.
