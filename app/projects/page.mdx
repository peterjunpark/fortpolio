# Projects

Some projects I've been working on recently. Most likely either to learn something, or just for fun.

## [Crosswordfish](https://crosswordfish.vercel.app)

An crossword puzzle generator powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5. This one was more of a passion project.

Another Twittter clone. I used this one to get comfortable with Next.js' server actions
