# Projects

Stuff I've been working on recently â€” to improve my skills, get comfortable with unfamiliar technologies, or just for fun.

## [Crosswordfish](https://crosswordfish.vercel.app)

As a crossword enjoyer, I'm was peeved by the fact that there were no good websites where I could play crossword puzzles.
The ones out there today are either infested with ads, cost a subscription fee, or have less-than-stellar UX.

Enter Crosswordfish: a crossword puzzle generator powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5. While it's just an MVP at this point,
the crossword grid and clues fill the viewport, the grid is keyboard navigable, and I think it's pretty easy on the eyes
(thanks [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)).

Lots to improve on, namely, performance, diversity of generated grid layouts, error handling, support for more complicated clues
and grid, responsive design on mobile, etc.

## [Y (Twytter)](https://twytter-1.vercel.app)

A Twitter clone; not the most original project. I built Y in an effort to improve my understanding of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
as a _full stack_ framework using its newest and most hyped feature at the time: Server Actions.

My main learning outcomes in building Y were [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io), PostgreSQL, [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev)
for OAuth, and modern page rendering in Next.js (SSG, SSR, and CSR).

## [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-flame.vercel.app/)

A sorting algorithm visualizer to demonstrate common sorting algorithm patterns. It helps you internalize a mental picture what these
algorithms actually do; if you can visualize it, you can code it.

I built this project in Next.js (for some reason) using the App Router even though almost the entire app is rendered on the client-side anyway.

## ShelterSeek

A platform for animal shelters to connect with potential adopters.

<GithubStatsCard variant="repo" repo="ElisaMarchete/ShelterSeek" />

My team and I built this as our capstone project at our coding bootcamp.
Under the hood, it is a basic CRUD application powered by the [MERN](https://arc.net/split/76D86CAC-3A6C-40CD-A87B-423C0F791D77)
stack featuring user authentication via JWTs, payment processing via [Stripe](https://stripe.com), image uploads, and a functional user interface
relying on [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) components.
