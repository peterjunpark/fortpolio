# Projects

Some projects I've been working on recently â€” to improve my skills, get comfortable with unfamiliar technologies, or just for fun.

## [Crosswordfish](https://crosswordfish.vercel.app)

As a crossword enjoyer, I'm peeved by the fact that there are no good websites to play crossword puzzles.
The ones out there today are either infested with ads, cost a subscription fee, or have less-than-stellar UX.

Enter Crosswordfish: a crossword puzzle generator powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5. While it's just an MVP at this point,
the crossword grid and clues fill the viewport, the grid is keyboard navigable, and I think it's pretty easy on the eyes (thanks [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)).

In working on this project, I focused on the ins and outs of top-down client-side state management through [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction).

## [Y (Twytter)](https://twytter-1.vercel.app)

A Twitter clone; not the most original project. I built Y in an effort to improve my understanding of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as a _full stack_ framework
using its controversial new features at the time: the App Router and Server Actions.

My main learning outcomes in building Y were [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/), PostgreSQL, [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) for authentication, and modern page rendering in Next.js (SSG, SSR, and CSR).

```ts showLineNumbers{5}
type hello = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const thisIsAVeryVeryVeryVerySuperDuperLongLineFunctionfdskla;jfads = function() {
    return "hello world"
  }

const herro: hello = {name: "peter", age: 28}
```

## [Sorting Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithm-visualizer-flame.vercel.app/)

A sorting algorithm visualizer to demonstrate common sorting algorithms.

My team and I built this as our capstone project at our coding bootcamp.
